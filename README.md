# Pixel-Lineal
VB6 Pixel ruler &amp; screenshot editor 

Many years ago, at the time of VB4, I developed a small application for my own use. Later I offered it as freeware on my homepage. Now I decided to release the source code for it. As I said, this is partly 20 years old and new source code from me, spiked with sources from different internet sources.
I personally still use the tool today, especially since I expanded it to a small image editor for screenshots in the meantime. What can be done with it can be seen in the online documentation. All images there were created with the pixel ruler. Also interesting for VB developers: There is only one exe and no other dependencies. Apart from the VB runtime used and some API functions (e.g. GDI+) everything is open VB source code!

If you want to take a closer look without having to familiarize into the sources, you can view and follow the project at
